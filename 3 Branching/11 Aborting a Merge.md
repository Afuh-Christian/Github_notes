# 11 Aborting a Merge    ....  2:37:57   

- We could run into a conflict 
- what if we are not ready to handle the conflict at the moment 
- we  abort 
    - we go back to the state before we started the merge ..


> git merge --abort 



- so if we resolved a conflict and staged the changes , those resolutions are gone .. 
- we're back to a clens  stage before we started the merge .
