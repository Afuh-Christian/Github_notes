# 1 Workflows      3:15:57 

# Vertion controll system fall into two groups , 
# - Centralized systems
- Single repository 
- shared by all team members
    - Drawback 
        - everyone is dependent on this repository
        - if server holding this repository goes offline , no one can commit or view the project history



# - Distributed systems
- Like Git 
- Every developer has a repository on their machine
    - Advange 
        - they are not dependent on a central server 
        - they can work offline with the local repository 

- How can we collaborate with this model 
    - We could synchronize our work directly with each other 
        - this often too complext and error prone
    - So instead ,we can use a "CENTRALIZED WORKFLOW" 










# .............CENTRALIZED WORKFLOW .....for private teams 

- Everyone has a local repository 
- But there is a central repository they use to synchronize their work


(Local Repo) <---> (Central Repo) <---> (Local Repo)

- No sigle point of failure
- if central Repo is not available , we can synchronize the work directory with another local repo
 

  (Local Repo) <---> (Local Repo)

- So where should the central repository be so that it's accessible to all team members
    - Some organisations use 
        - Private server 
        - Git hosting services like(Cloud services)
            - github
            - gitlab 
            - gitbucket etc .




# Example 


 John   <-->  (central repo)   <-->   Amy


 John and Amy wants to collaborate on a project 

# step 1 
- they both cloning(taking a copy of) the CENTRAL REPO 
- Now they both have a local repo on their machine

# John 
- John starts working and makes a few commits (Amy could also be making commits)
- For John to share his work with amy 
    - he uses the <push> command  to send his commits to the central repository
- Now the CENTRAL REPO  is in sync with John's work

# Amy 
- Amy can use the <pull> command to bring in John's work into her local repository
- If John's work , conflicts with Amy'swork ?         
    - she'll has to resolve the conflict 
    - Then <push> her work to the CENTRAL REPO 

# NB ... so this is the centralized workflow which is used in most private teams 
                            

















# ........INTEGRATION-MANAGER............for open source projects .....

        Project repo 


        maintainer                  contributor




- 1 or more maintainer 
- Many contributors 
    - Drawback 
        - we do not knows these contributors
        - we can't give them <push> or <write> access to our repository
- Only the maintainers of the project have  <push> access to the project repo  

# if you want to contribute 
- <Fork> the project repository to get a copy of the repository in the cloud 
- We <clone> this repository to get a local copy on our machine
- We do  a few commits 
- when we are ready to share our work , we <push> to projec repo copy in cloud
- We send a <pull> request to the maintainer of the project .
    - This is a feature built into platforms like github
- So now the maintainer of the project gets notified 
    - They can <pull> in our changes in the Project repo copy 
    - If they like it 
        - They'll <merge> our work with their local repo 
        - Then push it to the Official repository

# this is called the intergration-manager workflow , because someone is incharge of intergration changes
