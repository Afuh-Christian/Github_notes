........Git..........

Git is the most popular version control system in the world 

A Version control system records the changes made to our code over time 
in a special database called the 'REPOSITORY'

We can look  at the project history an see who has made what changes 
, when and why 

We can revert  our project back to an early stage if we are early enough

Without the vcs ,we will have to store different version of our projects in 
different folders 
	-this is very slow and does no scale at all (espacially if multiple people have to work on thesame project )
