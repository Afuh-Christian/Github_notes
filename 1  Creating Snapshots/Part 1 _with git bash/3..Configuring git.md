# Default setting we should define 
- Name 
- Email 
- Default Editor 
- Line Ending ( how git should handle line ending ) 


# this config setting can be done at different levels 

- SYSTEM LEVEL --all users 
- GLOBAL   --- all repositories of the current user 
- LOCAL  ----The current repository (repository in the current folder )

# set defualt edidtor ... --wait = we tell the terminal window to wait untill we close the  new vscode instance
>git config --global core.editor "code --wait" 

# All the config settings are stored in a text file , ... we can edit that file using our defualt editor , in this case vscode

# Back in the terminal window ., the terminal is waiting for u to close vscode

# how git should handle end of lines else we can run into errors 
- \r  = carriage return 
- \n  = Line Feed 
Configure .... core.autocrlf (carriage return line feed ) 



>git config --global core.autocrlf true



# ON WINDOWS ... End of lines 
- \r  = carriage return 
- \n  = Line Feed


# Mac PCs  ... End of lines 
- \n  = Line Feed

# NB .... if end of lines are not handled properly , we will have issues along the road 

To prevent this  , we have to configure a property called ".core.autocrlf"
-crlf - carriage return , line feed



# Example .... Two People working on thesame repository 00:11:45
A(windows)                B(mac) 

# A
- when A wants to check in his code in the repo , git should remove the carriage return character from end of lines 
- Simililarly when A checks out his code from his repo , git should update "end of lines" and add the "carage return  character"
- To archieve this behaviour , we should set this property to "true" .... 

# B    ... on the other hand 
- when B checks out the code , she doesn't want the carraige return character , so git should not touch end of lines 
- However , if carage return is accidentally added to end of lines , perhabs because of the editor that B is using , git should remove it when storing the code in the repository
- To archeive this behaviour  , we should set this property to "input"
- Which means each should only modify the end of lines when storing the code in the repository


# Terminal .. .... 
>git config --global core.autocrlf true

NB 
- on winodows ... set to = true
- on mac ... set to = input
