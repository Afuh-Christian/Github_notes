# Why Rewrite History 4:25:43 .. 

 # Why do we need history ? 
- we need it to see <what> was changed , <why> and <when> 
- If our commits are 
    - Not meaninful 
    - Large and contain unrelated changes 
    - small and scattered all over the history .. 
    Then we can't extract meaningful info from the hisory ... 
- We want a <clean readable history> that tells the story of our project (how it's evolved from day 1)
    - This is where <Rewriting the History> comes in ...

# <Rewriting the history> 
- If you have  <small related commits> 
    - <squash> them into a single commit that represents a logical chain set
- If you have a <large unrelated commits>
    - <split> them into a bunch of smaller commits each representing a logically separate chain set ... 
- We can <Reword commit messages> so they are more meaningful
- We can <drop unwanted commits> 
- We can <modify content of our commits> (e.g include a forgotten file .)




# NB ... Rewriting history can be a dangerous operation ... 
 - You need to know what you're doing before attempting this ...
